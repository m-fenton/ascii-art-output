ascii-art-output

This task stems form the original ascii-art project and will work the same but with some optional additions.
When running ascii-art-output you can choose to have the result written into a newly created file rather than display in the terminal.

For example -
If you run the below command in the terminal you will have your string written into a new file named "result01.txt".

go run . --output=result01.txt "your string"

As covered in another of the optional tasks for the ascii-art main project you can also choose to specify your art work to be written in one of three fonts.
As a final argument in the command line you can choose the fonts "shadow', "standard" and "thinkertoy".

go run . --output=result01.txt "your string" "shadow"
